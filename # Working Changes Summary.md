## Uncommitted Changes

Initial implementation of form handling system for migrant worker documentation

Establishes a complete client-side application for managing multiple employment-related form templates
and handling form data collection through a structured JSON-based approach with dynamic form generation.

### Changes

- Created core application structure with form templates and state management
- Implemented dynamic form generation system based on JSON schemas
- Added template files for multiple form types (BT44, BT46, BT52, BT55, employment contract)
- Created UI components for form navigation and data entry
- Implemented form data collection and export functionality

### Impact

- Code Structure
  - Establishes global state management through `currentFormData` object
  - Uses modular template approach with separate JSON files for each form type
  - Implements error handling and success notifications

- Behavioral Implementation
  - Dynamic form generation based on JSON templates
  - Form switching with state preservation
  - Data collection and export to JSON file
  - Client-side validation and error handling

- Dependencies
  - Requires PDF-lib library for future PDF generation
  - Uses external fonts (Sarabun) for Thai language support
  - Relies on modern browser features for Blob and File API

- Technical Considerations
  - Form state is maintained in memory only
  - All processing happens client-side
  - Uses modern JavaScript features (async/await, template literals)
  - Implements responsive design through CSS media queries
